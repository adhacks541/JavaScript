# JavaScript Concepts

This repository contains my personal JavaScript learning notes and experiments.

## Topics Covered
- **Scope**: Global, Block, and Functional scope.
- **Variables**: `var`, `let`, `const` differences.
- **Hoisting**: How different variable types behave during hoisting.
- **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**: Understanding variable accessibility before initialization.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Check the browser console for outputs (if any).
